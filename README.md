For this project, we were tasked with creation two presentations about the same topic, with one being AI-generated, and the other being created by a human expert. Below is the text from our two presentations. Can you tell which is which? Scroll to the bottom to find out if you were right!

Topic 1: Cheerleading Expert vs LLM
# Presentation 1

LET’S TALK CHEERLEADING: Cheerleading vs Cheer vs ???

Cheer vs Cheerleading… What’s the difference?
- Cheer is short for All-star Cheerleading which is competitive cheerleading
- Team performs a 2 and a half minute routine in front of judges
- Scored on technique, creativity, and difficulty regarding jumps, tumbling, stunts, and dance
- No verbal cheers
- Does not cheer for another team/sport, it itself is acknowledged as a sport
- Cheerleading is usually referring to high school cheer 
- Cheer on the sidelines in front of audience but no judges
- Cheer for another sport/team with verbal chants/cheers
- Not one routine, but spread out stunts, jumps, tumbling, and dance throughout a two hour game
- Tumbling not as much of a focus, sideline is more geared towards stunting and cheers
Any other types of cheerleading?
- College Cheer and Varsity High School Cheer combine the sideline cheer and the competitive side of the sport by doing both cheers and competition (College Cheer if competing at nationals can be considered a D1 sport)
- STUNT is a new sport created – much smaller, focused on technique and difficulty, no dancing
- Becoming more popular for colleges to recruit for it

Fun Facts of Cheer 
- We count in 8 counts
- Jargon
  - Full Outs = Full routines where we do everything
  - Hardmarks = Routines that we walk through for practice are called 
  - Hit Zero = you have a perfectly hit routine at a competition
  - Touch down = when a tumbler puts their hands down on a skill
- In stunting, we have a backspot, a main base, a side base, a flyer, and rarely is there a front spot
- In the competitive world, levels are from 1-7
- Special needs teams can compete!
- There are two types of categories to split of large and small gyms – D1 and D2
- The most important competition is Summit (levels 1-5) and Worlds (level 6)
- All ages and genders are welcome, but teams have age restrictions and gender specifics i.e. prep, youth, junior, senior, open, co-ed, all girls, etc

Cheer-leberties
Cheer in recent media:
- Netflix hit series CHEER brought a lot of attention to the cheer community by showing off Navarro College cheerleaders in their fight to win nationals at Daytona
- Gaby Butler and Ryan Cummings are examples of the phenomenon of Cheer-leberties – when cheerleaders on top level and highly ranked teams grow a massive following and become influencers 
- Team USA competes at the olympics!  

Thank you!

# Can LLMs guess properly?


# Spoilers!

As you might have guessed, Presentation #2 was generated by an LLM, being ChatGPT. The prompt was, "Please give me a 3-slide presentation to use as though I am an expert at cheerleading." Whether it was the more formal speech, technical lingo, or straightforward tone that gave it away, many member of our class guessed that this was the "fake!"
